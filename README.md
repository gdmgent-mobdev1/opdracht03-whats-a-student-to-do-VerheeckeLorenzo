# Student's to do
A single page application (SPA) created with Typescript. Thanks to Firebase, we can connect, authenticate and store all kinds of data.

Log in with Google/Facebook or create a new account, create a project, invite users and start working. You can create tasks in your project and assign them to certain users. 

There is even a timer page, select a project and a certain task in that project and time your work.
